# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.

My name is Chris and I am trying to switch careers from Agriculture/Plant and Soil Science into technology. I'm 44 years old and feel like I could be a great addition to any team. I have been teaching myself computer science and coding for over a year now and am looking to get my foot in the door somewhere. I have been using freeCodeCamp.org and learned responsive web design(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and am currently in the middle of learning Python.
